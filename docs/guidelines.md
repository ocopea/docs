# Project Guidelines

## Code Reviews
All code has been reviewed by someone other than the author.
This can be part of the development process where pair programming is
practiced.  For pull requests into the master branch there are processes in
place to enforce code reviews and merge approvals.  Only reviewed code,
unchanged from what has been approved, is merged.

## Testing
Developers can build code locally.  Developers can run tests (unit test and
functional test) locally.  Tests are repeatable and automated.  Under Test
Driven Development tests are developed before the code.  No code is to be
delivered without having tests that validate the code.

## Documentation
Code has user facing documentation on how to build, install and use.
Documentation is delivered with code.
