# User Guide

Ocopea is an open source project that introduces the concept of application
copy, or app-copy, for cloud native application development. An app-copy is
implemented by retaining a mapping of the application and its services, such as
a backing datastore.  The information of this mapping can then be forwarded
in bug reports, tracking stories and email.

The exact environment at the time of the app-copy can be then recreated as a
separate instance by anyone, for purposes of testing, debugging or for general
understanding of the application behavior at that point in time with that
specific dataset.
