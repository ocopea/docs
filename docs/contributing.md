## Development Philosophy

Work on this project is guided by a number of principles.

Develop only what is needed to achieve the goal; make use of concepts, tools
and software that are already available. "Stand on the shoulders of giants".
Make smart choices for dependencies.  Focus on outcomes. Plan with the
objective to close the gap between where the project is and where it needs to
be.  Revisit next steps regularly as the goal becomes clearer and knowledge
more complete.

## API First

Interfaces are well defined and understood by both the service provider and the
client of the service.  Use tools to separate interface and implementation.

## T-Model

TBD

## Continuous Integration

Code is covered by straightforward CI pipeline that includes repeatable steps
such as build, (unit) test and deliver to artifactory.

## Disclaimer
